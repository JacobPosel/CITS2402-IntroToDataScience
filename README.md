# CITS2402-IntroToDataScience

This was a small assignment for the unit CITS2402 - Introduction to Data Science. In which we were tasked with loading, cleaning and analysing Australian census data. My focus was on whether women do more unpaid domestic work than men, and is there a generational change in traditional gender roles.
